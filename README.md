## **Description**

This project presents a fundamental bank management system operated via a Command Line Interface, leveraging Python programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It facilitates essential banking operations where users can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, transfer funds, and take loans. Administrators have additional privileges such as creating user accounts, deleting user accounts, and managing bank operations.


## **Features**
- **User Functionalities**:
  - User account creation and management
  - Deposit and withdrawal transactions
  - Transfer funds between accounts
  - Loan management
  - Transaction history
  - Bankrupt account management

- **Admin Functionalities:**
  - Create user accounts
  - Delete user accounts
  - View users list
  - View total bank balance
  - View total loan amount
  - Set user as bankrupt
  - Enable/disable loan feature

- User-friendly command-line interface (CLI)
